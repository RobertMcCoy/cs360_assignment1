# CS360 - Sedlmeyer - Assignment 1
9 Days to make an entirely functional Chess Club Management System with fully functional authentication, bracket building, results viewing, and role levels. Oh...and you only get 20 hours per person. What could go wrong?

# Information
This is an MVC project built on top of ASP.NET Core utilizing EntityFramework. The database backend is created from the ChessClubManagement.sql

# Libraries
This uses Auth0 as the authentication source (9 days was not enough time to make our own hashing/user setup)

# Members
Robert McCoy, David Looser, Andrea Moorman, Lars Hinniger, and Kurtis Taylor
